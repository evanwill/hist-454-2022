## Digitization Project

Digitization is a means to open up more access to traditional archival materials, enabling new forms of inquiry and communication.
In the images we create and the information (metadata) we publish, we strive to represent the original source materials and maintain the integrity of the records as accurately as possible.

For this project digitizing photographs and textual documents, using a flatbed scanner is the safest and most effective means of preserving the information in an item and allowing others to access it.

### Scanning 

{% capture text %}**Before you scan**:
Make sure that hands are clean and dry when handling materials for scanning or any type of digitization work; all materials should be handled with care and attention. These items cannot be replaced or easily repaired if destroyed or damaged.{% endcapture %}
{% include feature/alert.html text=text color="warning" %}

CDIL's scanning stations will be set up and ready for you to work.
Below is an overview of the steps:

- Open EpsonScan scanning software
- Place item to be scanned along the left side of the scanning bed (the glass plate), leaving a slight border between item and edge. 
- Position the Color Separation Guide so that the "saturated" bar is beside the item being scanned (along the bottom edge of the item is fine). Be sure to leave a 1/8-inch gap between the guide and the item.
- Close the scanner lid and press "Preview" in EpsonScan. Once the preview scan is finished, use the cursor to draw the selection window around the item and as much of the Color Separation Guide as is needed to color balance the item. There should not be a lot of space between the item and the edges of the selection window; see below:
    {% include figure.html img="screenshot-2.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="" width="100%" %}
- For this project, images and documents should be scanned at **300 dpi** and should be at least **3,000 pixels** on the long edge. This measurement is located at the bottom left of the preview panel. The color filter should be set to "none".
    {% include figure.html img="screenshot-3.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="" width="50%" %}
- Once your settings are correct, press "Scan". The "File Save Settings" window will pop up and you will need to:
    - Click "Other" and then "Browse" to select the folder you want your scanned images to be saved to. This should be the designated folder on the desktop.
    - Set up the File Name prefix following this project's naming convention, `hist454-` + your initials. The Start Number should be at 01 if you're starting your scanning. 
    - In the Image Format section, the file type should be set to JPEG (*.jpg).
    {% include figure.html img="screenshot-4.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="" width="50%" %}
- Press "OK" and the scan will begin.

Create PDFs for documents?

Once you have completed you batch of scanning, upload the final files (with correct filenames!) into the shared Google Drive folder.
