# Mining the Archives Project Overview

## Digitization 

> [digitize, v. to transform analog information into digital form](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/digitize.html)

Digitization is the process of creating a digital representation of physical materials--for example, scanning a photograph to create a digital JPEG image or scanning using OCR on a print document to create a PDF.
In the digital files we create and the information we publish, we strive to represent the original source materials and maintain the integrity of the records as accurately as possible.
By converting physical information into a digital format, digitization can open up more access to traditional archival materials and enable new forms of inquiry and communication.

We often take for granted the millions of archival documents and artifacts available online, without thinking about the long chain of people and processes that created them.
Digitization in archives has transformed historical research in many ways, so it is important to understand and think critically about.
This project asks you to get hands on with that process, bringing physical materials from the archive into the digital world!

## Curation

No collection can contain and represent everything from the relevant historical record. 
Selections and interventions were made a multiple points along the trajectory of each record, from the original creators, to natural disasters, to the collecting organizations, to the archivists, to the historians sifting through boxes...
Each of these choices bring biases, [archival silences](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/archival-silence.html), and new interpretations.

Your first project in curation is selecting your objects for digitization from the archives.
We would like you to go further, enhancing the final *Mining the Archives* project by selecting five items from U of I digital collections relevant to your research questions.
This hands on experience 

## Metadata 

> [description, n., a set of data crafted to identify and represent an archival resource or component thereof](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/description.html)

> [descriptive metadata, n., Information that refers to the intellectual content of material and aids discovery of such materials. Notes: Descriptive metadata allows users to locate, distinguish, and select materials on the basis of the material's subjects or 'aboutness.'](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/descriptive-metadata.html)

Description and metadata is essential to archives and digital collections, profoundly impacting user experience, discoverability, and bias. 
The practice of creating metadata is an act of research and interpretation.
This assignment seeks to build a thoughtful and critical understanding of finding aids and digital collections, by actually creating metadata yourself.

The practice of describing objects is an entire discipline of academic study--so there is a lot to think critically about--but an important take away is simply that metadata is made by humans like you!
As metadata creators, we seek to do our best to represent the important information about the archival materials in the context of the collection--creating metadata that will help future users (and yourselves) find, contextualize, and understand the objects in the collection.

The metadata template is the set of descriptive fields that we will use for all items to ensure consistency across the collection.
Both digitized and curated objects will be described using the same metadata template.
The fields are based on [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) and other standards and conventions used in digital libraries. 
This helps our metadata be compatible with other systems and helps other people understand our descriptive practice.

## Digital Collection

> [online exhibition, n. a curated display of archival resources accessible via the internet. Notes: Not simply a digital collection, an online exhibition is a collection of interrelated archival resources focused around a theme.](https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/online-exhibition.html)

Everyone's work on the project will contribute to the *Mining the Archives* digital collection.
Once objects and metadata are complete, the CDIL team will add them to the [project repository](https://github.com/thecdil/hist-454-2022) hosted on GitHub.
