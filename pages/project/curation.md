# Curation Guidelines

Having explored the physical archives, we are now asking you to explore the digital version and consider the difference between these experiences.

Visit U of I Library digital collections and explore to find at least five additional records relevant to the project. 
Explore the different browsing features of the collections, such as clouds, maps, and timelines to see how these visualizations impact your discoveries. 
Sort and filter the browse pages, click through some item pages, download some files, try full text search. 
How is this experience different from leafing through boxes and folders? 

## Collections to Explore

U of I digital collections contain many [mining related collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/collections.html#Mining).
In particular, take a look at these collections which relate to the archival boxes you viewed in Spec:

- [Bunker Hill Labor Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/bunkerhill/)
- [Barnard-Stockbridge Photograph Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/barstock/)

Try to find items that are different from what the course already digitized, looking for records that can supplement the stories and narratives that you are interested in exploring.

## How to Create Metadata Records

Your five items will be recorded in your copy of the metadata template, following exactly the same conventions as your newly digitized items. 

In this case, you will be looking at an item with already existing metadata. 
However, the metadata fields might not exactly match our project template. 
Sometimes, the existing record may not have all the fields in our template or they will be named slightly different.
Create your own original metadata based on your understanding of the object, just as you did for digitized objects.

You can copy values from the existing record into our template (see [spreadsheet tips for how to copy and paste]({{ '/spreadsheets.html' | relative_url }}), but also feel free to write your own metadata. 
You are curating these objects for a new context, which means you may interpret the metadata slightly differently--or perhaps you have insights or research knowledge that enriches the existing information. 

Think about why you choose this particular item for our exhibit project and ensure those reasons are reflected in the metadata.

### filename field

For the "filename" field, you will need to list the full URL to download the item.

On most of our item pages, you will find a "Download" button. 
Right click on the button and select "Copy link address" to copy the URL. 
Then use Ctrl+V to paste it into your Sheet.

If you encounter a CONTENTdm item page, for image items you can right click on the preview image and select "Copy image address". 
For PDF items, right click on the download icon, and select "Copy link".
These options might not work as expected, but they *do* contain the information needed so we can fix it later! 
Alternatively, try to find the item you are viewing on CONTENTdm back in the main collection interface and copy the download links from there.

### source field

If your curated item has a Source field available in the existing metadata, please copy it into your record, and add a link to the item page after.
If it has none, simply copy the link to the item page into your "source" field.
