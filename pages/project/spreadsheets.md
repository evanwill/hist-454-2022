# Working with Spreadsheets

We will be creating our metadata in a spreadsheet on Google Sheets.
When creating metadata in a spreadsheet we tend to use this terminology:

- columns => "fields" (the individual elements used to describe specific qualities of the objects)
- rows => "records" or "items" (each row represents one object's description)
- cells => "values" (the individual chunks of metadata)
